# Description
For this assginment, a interactive dashboard visualization was created from a csv containing data on athletic clothing from different brands. This dashboard utilized plotly dash and created a box plot of clothing prices based on a user's chosen material and clothing category they want to observe from dropdowns, and a bar chart of prices vs. frequency based on a user's chosen materials they want to observe from a checkbox and size from a slider.
